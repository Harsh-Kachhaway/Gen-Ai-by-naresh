== 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

sample demo -- you just listen today & practise 

day after tomorrow onward bi

typing -- 10 min 
15mint -- softskills 


	
chatgpt -- build calculator app -- 
geneatvei ai -- geneate the code 
user -- copy the code past in software then app will generate 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc 

agentic ai --- 
smolagents 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc  |
		user or developer copy the code past the build project 
		
agentic ai --> agent write the code, validation , bug fixes every thing is done by agent 

2025-- many company layoff ( fired manager,experince, )
manager - done by chagt, agentic ai frameworsk 

all experience must should learn agentic ai 

ai not kill the job
learners who learn ai they automized the job 

generative ai models are divide into 2 part -->

1- text based model (user enter text -- model generate text) 
2- text to image | text to audio | text to video -- multimodel 

SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
syntax error -- erro which happens from user side or developer 


270000 inr without recording ( nit doesnot provid recording)

---
syntax -->
---
variable name = value 
value = datatypes 

python important datatypes

	integer
	float
	bool
	string
	complex 
variable - every
function always ends with () 

3function I define hear 

family() -- this family fun with no argument 
family1(d, m) --> family1 2 argument or parameter 
family2(d, m, s, d) -- family 4 argument or parameter 


variable & function 

german_cars(bmw, audi, mer, fer, lambo) 
asina_cars(tata, mahindra, maruthi)


if user or developer want to get more then 1 output -- use print()
if use print only 1 output (not required) 

variable 
function()
functional argument | function parameter 
python operator == + ,- , * 

 
int - value without decimal
float - value with decimal
float only e letter is allowed 
string -- always declare with '' || " " | ''' '''

	 ''' -- we used for multiline comments 
complex -- a + bj 
	a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1 
	
==== 16th 
+91 9154861173 - Mr.Areef  & i will share the qr code at last 
qr code -- course syllbus, recording lecture 

we install software IDE 
	VS CODE 
	ANACONDA -- JUPYTER & SPYDER 
	
I will share the link please instlal & let me know if you have any issue 


python interpreter -- run or excute the code line by line or part of the code 
python compiler -- entire code run at once  
python is both ( interpretter or compiler) both programming language 

ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide user or developer can run the code, write the code, fix the error 

which ide we installed 
	vs code ide 
	jupyter ide 
	spyder ide 
	pycharm ide 

using ide we build ml project, ai project, gen ai project, cicd , mlops, 

Other datatypes to int -- completed 

1- All other datatypes to integer 
float to int -- possible | bool to int - possible | number string to valid but text string to int - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to int | complex to int | user cannot define 2 argument at once

2- All Other datatypes to float 
int to float -- possible | bool to float - possible | number string to float valid but text string to float - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to float | complex to float | user cannot define 2 argument at once	
	
3- All other datatype to string 
	all other datatype to string | no issue at all 
	
4- All other datatype to Bool
	non zero argument if you define bydefaulat it will detect as true 
	zero argument then it will detect false 
	we can type cast from all other data types to bool 

5- All other dataypes to complex
	complex - only 1 string will be allowed as parameter 
	
== python type casting we are completed today

=== 16th
if you are non tech you never code before 

1st -- what ever document I will share to please watch it and complete 
2nd -- same coder after 30min -- donot watch and write ( 1day, 2day, 3day, 30min) 
3rd -- after 3day ( write win10min) 

how to transit non technical - technical ( use 1 code -- 3times, 4th time just view) 

everyday -  I need your time to make you success 

=== 17th 

- did you got google classroom acces 
	if you dident get please get the access quick from offline admin or online adming

	mentor vs mentor vs faculy 
after the class if you have any question please ask to mentor if you stuck some bugs 
online link, annoucment, relavent to your payment -- admin

=== python introduction
=== python variable
=== python datatypes 
=== python typecasting 
=== PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE 
	list 
	tuple
	set
	dict 

Datatype vs Datastrcture 

DATA TYPE -- USER CAN declare only 1 value 
DATA STRUCTURE -- user can declare more then 1 value is called data structure
 
e - exponential 
only e is allowed no other character are allowed 

what is mean be datatype 
what is mean by datastructure 
what is mean by matrix = 1d, 2d, nd 
what is mean by table == rows & columns 

datatype - int, float, string, complex, bool 
lets explore more on string part 

id() -- address of the memory allocation 
a = 10 ( system memory id has crate with some location 
---
INDEXING -->
---
	forward index - left index to right index ( start from 0) 
	backward index -- right index to left index ( starting from -1) 
	step index -- 


iq -- python ( can you please reverse the string) | indexing concept 

fun() -- 2 types 
	inbuild function -- print() id() len()
	user define function 

---
slicing --> : 
--
	forward slicing 
	backward slicing 
	step slicing 


online & Offline I humble request you please listen to me what I am saying
doesnot what error you got () your 

==== 18th
python basic operator 
python bitwise operator 

in the market you see add full stack genearive ai & agentici course 
advaned gen ai & agentic ai 

you reach out to the right place -- day by 
my teaching + your learning + your practise + interview = resule = offer 

no. of variable = no. of values 

1- Arithmetic operator -- +, -, *, /, //, %, ** 
2- Assignment operator =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=
3- Relational operator >, <, >=, <=, ==, != 
4- Logical operator , and, or, not 
5- Unary operator - only 1 operator - (minus) 

online team -- every learning i want to tell you one thing 
	as you new the way -- keep worry about what eve your braing through question 
Online team i am speacking you are doing somehting -- after you cloass you drop off 
---
Truth table -->
---
and --> 1 and 1 is 1 rest of them are 0  
or --> 0 or - is 0 restr of them are 1 
not 

python basic operator we are completed 
python bitwise operator 
	complement operator 
	and operator 
	or operator 
	xor (xclusive or) 
	left shift 
	right shift 
	
if you are speed in typeing then please work with me on regular classes 
if you are slow in typing just focus listen thats enought( after the class please practicse)

these are fundametne i am speakin g( prob, distr, gau, action, optimizaet, r2, )  -- 
everyday is not easy concept 

complement operator ( ~)  = it store -ve values in the memory 

how to download the class notes 
do not worry about many hordking , manyu, advance genai, agentic ai , 

i will teach more advance -- you & leave i will 

before i will explain bitwise i forget to expaling number system 

python number system first then we will go for bitwise operator 
python number system -->

	1- binary number system (0b) ~ base 2 ( 0, 1) 
	2- octal number system (0o) base 8 ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) 
	3- decimal number system (0x)   base 10 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) 
	4- hexadecimal number syste (0xa,b,c,d,e,f)  based16 
						0-9 
						a - 10
						b - 11
						c - 12
						d - 13
						e - 14
						f - 15
						 
1:30hr listen the class & store in your brain gain
practise the class from the brain 
keep giving interview 
every interview you will fail 
you will clearn 1st round , 1st roun will fiak
clear 1st, 2ndround clearn again 2 nd round will fail 
20-30time 
1-- 1st, 2nd , hr -- selected but still they dont give offer 
finaly 1 offer is waiting for you which gods plance 

you will stop giving interview 

keep giving interve- fail - ignore untill offer is sitting in your gmail box 
never trust any -- HR never ever trust 
never ever backdorr -- client will send you frontdoor 
2l -- they ( client meeting ) never ever give money to any consultan 

== share me github in classroom
 
=== 21st 

everyday I will share the documnent, code explanation, code or project
So immedietly download all the thigs to your desktop  ( daily basis)

I will share today sat & today class explanation 

bin() -- 2 | oct() - 8 | decimal (10) hex - 16

why we are learning this 


we are learning basic python 
advance python 
oops python 
project ml , ai, dl project 

list of topics -- 
intorduce to pythin, python identifier, datatypes, typecasting, basic operator, number system 

bitwise operator 
	complement operator - done  
	and operator - done 
	or operator - done 
	xor (xclusive or) - done 
	left shift << 
	right shift >> 

computer vision project 

machine which device recognize your face 
to build these project we want hese python learning 

today we are complete python operator, bitwise operator 
----
print() in python -->
-----
fun()

print() user can pass 1 argument, or n number of argument 

1- print result with string 
2- print Format method ( .format() number of variable == {} 
	if you define 2 variable -- 2 
3- f string method
4- end statement 
5- separator 



if some feels not understnain -- that's mean not listenging class 
if you are note -- all the notes ( practise)
ask to the mentor ( chagpt)
ask me I will explain 


Everyday you need to revise previous class 
Every week end of the day please revise weekly classes 

==== 22nd 

python datatype -- user define only 1 value | a = 5, b = 5.5
python datastructure -- user define more then 1 value or 1 elements 
a = 2,3,4
	
	Inbuild ds ( primitive ) - LIST, 
				   TUPLE, 
				   SET, 
				   DICT, 
				   RANGE 
	user define ds (non primitive)
				STACK
				LINKEDLIST 
				ARRAY 
				TREE  
 all user define data structure will take care by some library or framework 

without learning inbuild data structure  we never build any project 


List -->
  .append() - add the element at last 
  .copy() - copy one list to another list 
  list is mutable ( user can change any elements or any items)
  indexing is allowed in the list 
  slicing is allowed in the list 
  duplicate are allowed 

items, values, element, member 

index & slicing -->
	forward index 
	backward index 
	step index 

: -->  print all element = value = items == memeber

2:4 --> print element starting from 2nd index till n-1 3rd index
		right side only applicable n-1 

:4 --> starting index from 0th index to 3rd index 

4: --> starting from 4th index till last 

0:10:3 --> print index 0th index to 9th but print every 3rd index count skip other index 

::3 --> print start to last index print only 3rd index 

::-1 --> print the elements reverse 

::-2 --> print the element reverse -2 index position 

everyday you will recved codes & document 

code extension always ends with.py or.ipynb 

==== 23rd 

remove()- removed the first occurance of an item 
 call 3 time remove function 

list inside the list - nested list 
for loop inside for -- nested for 
while loop insiode while - nested while 


do not work if you are slow in typing 
just focus the class 1:20 min 
after the class what ever foucs please practicel with lapto 3hr 
day you spend 4.30 -- real learning 

remove() - remove the element from the list  by mentioned values to it 
pop() -- remove the element from the list mention index rateher element 

parameter ( system given default parameter)  | inbuild == builtin 
hyperparamter (user change the system parameter) | user remove w10-w11 ( hyperparameter) 
hyperparameter in generative ai we called hyperparamter tunning == finetuning  

sort() --
	user need to pass similar datatype to sort the elemnt or else it will give bugs 

: -- 4 spaces 
spaces technically we called as indentation 

intro to for loop 

if 0 value is present in the list all- false & any() - true 
if 0 value is not present in the list all & any -- print as true 

=== 24th 
Tuple = () 

list is mutable 
tuple is immutable 

john == [10, 20k,30k, 40k] 
mike = (10,20,30) 

list & tuple we are completed 


set & dict both assigned with {} 
for empty set user set() 

add()- add the element randomly to the set 

append() vs add()
discard() vs remove()
list vs tuple 


Set indexig & slicing is not allowed 

set 

skils -- project -- resume -- job markt -- interview -- fail - 1st rount -- reject 
	2nd roung -- reject -- hr round -- stop -- 20 interview -- 21st is offer 

20th you will interview 
21st give up 
next interview is offer -- next next offer 

keep giving interview -- keep fail - don't complain -- just move on -- get offer 
offer also -- keep giving interview -- hiring & firing 

=== SET OPERATION 

union 
intersection 
difference 
symmetric difference
